# mastermind-python
Python version of the game mastermind. Text-based game.


## Goal:
Just a little project to further deepen my understanding of python.

## Use:
A simple little program that lets you play mastermind the code-cracking game, to your hearts content.
But also fun to tinker with. Feel free to pick apart the code and mess around with it.
I've included a compiled version for those that don't want to install python, or mess around with an IDE.
For those that would like to know how I compiled to an executable:

first I installed pyinstaller via

```
pip install pyinstaller
```
then I compiled the source code by running the following command in the directory containing the source code file. 

```
pyinstaller -F mastermind.py
```

(this option is also for anyone that doesn't trust executables from some git.)
